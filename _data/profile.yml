  I am a fourth year undergraduate student at College of Engineering, Peking University (PKU), 
where I am advised by Prof. <a href="https://mengguo.github.io/personal_site/" target="_blank">Meng Guo</a> and 
Prof. <a href="http://www2.coe.pku.edu.cn/faculty/liuchang/index.html" target="_blank">Chang Liu</a>.
I am expected to receive my bachelor's degree in 2026. I am currently a research intern at AdaComp Lab, School of Computing, National University of Singapore, 
advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dyhsu/" target="_blank">David Hsu</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests lie at the intersection of task-planning, motion planning, learning, and control in robotic systems.
    I am particularly interested in developing task-planning systems that can plan and execute complex tasks in open-world environments.
