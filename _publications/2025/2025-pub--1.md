  Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic tar
gets can be tedious for a human operator and infeasible for
 a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks, detect intruders,
 search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be effective
 by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
 coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of
 the targets and the limited perception of each robot. Existing
 work often deploys all robots available without minimizing the
 fleet size, or neglects the constraints on their resources such as
 battery and memory. This work proposes an online coordination
 scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring,
 path routing and resource charging. It includes three core
 components: (I) the modeling of multi-robot task assignment
 problem under the constraints on resources and monitoring
 intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination algorithm
 iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets
 and the low-level multi-objective routing via the Martinâ€™s
 algorithm; (III) the online adaptation algorithm in case of
 unpredictable target behaviors and robot failures. It ensures
 the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all targets
 and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while
 minimizing the average number of active robots. The proposed
 methods are validated extensively via large-scale simulations
 against several baselines, under different road networks, robot
 velocities, charging rates and monitoring intervals.
